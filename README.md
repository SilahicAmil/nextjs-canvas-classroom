# How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate and end-to-end SaaS project

- I built this website based off of Canvas by Instructure: [Instructure Website](https://www.instructure.com/)
- I used detailed push commits to describe updates: [Example Commit](https://github.com/SilahicAmil/nextjs-canvas-classroom/commit/29d619e7413ccc0d4ea53d920d7b1105a276e53e)

# How to navigate this project

- Somewhat complex file fetching and uploading logic: [Example Code](https://github.com/SilahicAmil/nextjs-canvas-classroom/blob/main/components/CourseDetails/ModuleCard.js)
- Responsive CSS using Tailwind CSS / Daisy UI: [Example Code](https://github.com/SilahicAmil/nextjs-canvas-classroom/blob/main/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.js)
- Custom React Hooks: [Example Code](https://github.com/SilahicAmil/nextjs-canvas-classroom/tree/main/hooks)
- Unit Testing: [Example Code](https://github.com/SilahicAmil/nextjs-canvas-classroom/tree/main/__tests__)

# Why I built the project this way

- I chose the stack of Next.js, Tailwind, MongoDB and Supabase. To really test my knowledge or being able to intergrate multiple technologies together. From file routing, to document management and file uploading/fetching.
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer. Which is why I chose to do a full stack application. Testing my abilities on both front and back-end have been priceless.
- Testing is another key thing I wanted to focus in on. It's an essential part of production applications and I wanted to treat my application as if it were going to be one. Covering essential features to ensure they work.

# If I had more time I would change this

- Setup a CI/CD pipeline to run the tests. Also implement Pull Requests to have a linter so all developer have the same experience.
- Refactor Code
- More end-to-end testing
